# IJHS Spark 2025 Initiatives

Hey there! This repository powers our three Spark projects under the IJHS Global Student Leadership Council. Here’s how to get involved and make an impact.

> [!NOTE]
> Each project has its own **GitHub Project board**. Just create Issues, assign labels, and drag cards through the workflow.

## Getting Started

Here’s a quick overview of the repo structure:

- **.github/**  
  Templates for Issues & PRs
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**  
  How to get started and our guidelines
- **WORKFLOW.md**  
  Sprint & meeting cadence, roles, and definitions
- **docs/quickstart.pdf**  
  One-page “How to use GitHub Projects” cheat-sheet

To get started:

1. **Accept the repo invite** via your email registered with the GSLC.
2. Go to **Projects** → select **Your Project**
   - If you don’t see your project, please contact Peter!
3. Click **New issue**, give it a title, choose your project label, then **Submit**.
4. Drag your card from **To Do** → **In Progress** → **Done** as you work.
5. Use the **docs/quickstart.pdf** for screenshots and extra tips.

See [WORKFLOW.md](./WORKFLOW.md) for details.
